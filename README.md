# 🧠 IW4

A public collection of GSC scripts I’ve written for the IW4 engine — now available for anyone to use, learn from, or build on.

These scripts were made for IW4, but most of them can be reused across other games with little to no changes.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’ve been modding the IW4 engine since **2016**. What started as a love for trickshotting grew into a passion for scripting and gameplay design. I focus on making scripts that **add to the experience** — not ruin it.

Everything here is built with stability, fun, and player experience in mind.

## 🤝 Use & Credit

Feel free to fork, edit, or include these scripts in your own mods. No credit required — but always appreciated if you do.

Scripts in this repo will be updated fairly often, as I continue to build and share more useful tools with the community.
